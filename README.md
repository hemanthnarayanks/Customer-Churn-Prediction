# Customer Churn Prediction

This is a Customer Churn Prediction of a Network services providing company, the data was imported from Kaggle.

Customer churn (or customer attrition) refers to the loss of customers or subscribers for any reason at all. Businesses measure and track churn as a percentage of lost customers compared to total number of customers over a given time period. This metric is usually tracked monthly and reported at the end of the month.

This project is concentarted mostly on Data Preprocessing then Neural Network building.
Prediction includes, Type Casting, One Hot Encoding and Scaling.

Later, I used a Neural Network model with 3 hidden layers and 20 units each with Activation Function "ReLU" and an output layer with 1 unit and Activation Function "Sigmoid". As always "Adam" optimizer is used along with "Binary Cross Entropy" loss function, since the classification is Binary.
